Building this was about learning how to use javascript logic and familiarize myself with displaying data on the page. This project taught me about referenecing data within arrays and using listeners like buttons.
Reason for building was to figure out how to better utalize javascript logic and familurize my self with displaying data on a page. I learned how to impot text art into the page as well as find ways to better utalize color and images.
